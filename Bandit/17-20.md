## Level 17
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Password needed:\
`kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx`

1. Perform a port scan with nmap on localhost for range 31000 to 32000
```
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-15 04:29 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00015s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE SERVICE
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds
```

2. To extract the ports in a nicer format, use grep and sed
```
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost | grep -Eo '[0-9]+/tcp' | sed 's/\/tcp//'
31046
31518
31691
31790
31960
```

3. Check each port using netcat, where port 31790 is the valid open port:\
```bandit16@bandit:~$ ncat --ssl localhost 31790
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
Correct!

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

4. Create a temp file containing the key:
```
cd /tmp
touch ssh.key
vi ssh.key
```
Paste the key int the temp file and save it

5. Check the file permissions of the temp file and ensure it has RWX permissions for user
```
bandit16@bandit:/tmp$ ls -l ssh.key
-r-------- 1 bandit16 bandit16 1675 Feb 15 05:10 ssh.key
bandit16@bandit:/tmp$ chmod 700 ssh.key
```

6. SSH into the next level bandit17@bandit
```
ssh -i ssh.key -p 2220 bandit17@bandit
```

7. Now we are in the next level! However, we can find the password for this level in /etc/bandit_pass
```
bandit17@bandit:/$ cd /etc/bandit_pass/
bandit17@bandit:/etc/bandit_pass$ cat bandit17
EReVavePLFHtFlFsjn3hyzMlvSuSAcRD
```

Password:\
`EReVavePLFHtFlFsjn3hyzMlvSuSAcRD`

## Level 18
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and passwords.new**. The password for the next level is in **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**

1. Use diff to see difference between old and new
```
diff -y --suppress-common-lines passwords.old passwords.new
ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB                              | x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
```
The password was changed into `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`

2. Logging into bandit18@bandit with SSH fails however per the "Byebye!" message. We need to move on to the level to fix this.

Password:\
`x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`

## Level 19
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

1. From host machine, pass in a command to read the "~/readme" file into the SSH command
```
sshpass -p "x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO" ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org "cat ~/readme"
```  

Password:\
`cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8`

Notes:
- You can pass commands into ssh in quotation marks

## Level 20
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

1. There is a bandit20-do file in the home directory which appears to be an ELF 32-bit LSB Executable file
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ file bandit20-do 
bandit20-do: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=368cd8ac4633fabdf3f4fb1c47a250634d6a8347, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
This file is meant to be like setuid as mentioned in the explanation above.

2. Running bandit20-do appears to execute commands on behalf of bandit20
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```

3. Leveraging this, attempt to read bandit20's password from /etc/bandit_pass
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
```

Password:\
`0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO`
