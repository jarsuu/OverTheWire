## Level 26
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

### Solution
1. We are given the ssh key to bandit26 and when you try to ssh into bandit26, it only shows you some text and exists:
```
bandit25@bandit:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey -p 2220 bandit26@localhost

...

  _                     _ _ _   ___   __  
 | |                   | (_) | |__ \ / /  
 | |__   __ _ _ __   __| |_| |_   ) / /_  
 | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __| / / '_ \ 
 | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ / /| (_) |
 |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|____\___/ 
Connection to localhost closed.
```
This is due to the terminal not being `bin/bash` for bandit26 as seen from the passwd file:
```
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```

2. Analysing the showtext file shows that it runs `more`:
```
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext 
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```
So when you ssh into bandit26, it will `more` the ~/text.txt file and then exit. There is a way to exploit `more` by making the terminal display fewer lines to set `more` into interactive mode.

3. Shrink your terminal to display fewer lines and then ssh into bandit26:
```
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey -p 2220 bandit26@localhost

...

  _                     _ _ _   ___   __  
 | |                   | (_) | |__ \ / /  
--More--(33%)
```
If there are few enough lines, it should set into interactive mode. 

4. Press "v" to go into vim mode and then cat out the password file for bandit26.
```
:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

...

s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ
~                                                                                                
"/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26" [readonly] 1L, 33B    
```

5. You can gain a shell by setting the shell for bandit26 with the command `:set shell=/bin/bash` and then execute `:shell` to get a shell into bandit26
```
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
```

Password:\
`s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ`

## Level 27
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

### Solution
1. Starting from bandit26 with a shell, we can see a `bandit27-do` file which is a 32-bit LSB executable:
```
bandit26@bandit:~$ file bandit27-do 
bandit27-do: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=368cd8ac4633fabdf3f4fb1c47a250634d6a8347, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit27-do id
```

2. Read bandit27's password with the file:
```
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB
```

Password:\
`upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB`

## Level 28
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo` via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

### Solution
1. Make temp dir and clone the repo, where you need to specify ssh and connecting on port 2220:
```
bandit27@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.xtlYai004A
bandit27@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.xtlYai004A
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.xtlYai004A$ GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -p 2220" git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo
```
Type in the password used to login to bandit27.

2. Go into `repo` where there is a `README` file that will contain the password:
```
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.xtlYai004A$ cd repo
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.xtlYai004A/repo$ ls
README
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.xtlYai004A/repo$ cat README 
The password to the next level is: Yz9IpL0sBcCeuG7m9uQFt8ZNpS4HZRcN
```

Password:\
`Yz9IpL0sBcCeuG7m9uQFt8ZNpS4HZRcN`

## Level 29
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo` via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

### Solution
1. Make temp dir and clone the repo, where you need to specify ssh and connecting on port 2220:
```
bandit28@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac$ 
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-gi
t/repo
```
Type in the password for bandit28.

2. Go into `repo` and read the `README.md` file:
```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac$ cd repo/
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac/repo$ ls
README.md
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac/repo$ cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: xxxxxxxxxx

```
The file may have contained the password for bandit29 in the pass. We can check the history of the repo to find what the file looked like in the past, and hopefully get the password.

3. To view the history of commits, execute `git log`:
```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac/repo$ git log
commit 817e303aa6c2b207ea043c7bba1bb7575dc4ea73 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)

    fix info leak

commit 3621de89d8eac9d3b64302bfb2dc67e9a566decd

Date:   Thu Sep 19 07:08:39 2024 +0000

    add missing data

commit 0622b73250502618babac3d174724bb303c32182
Author: Ben Dover <noone@overthewire.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 19 07:08:39 2024 +0000

    initial commit of README.md
```
The commit with the message `add missing data` could be useful as it is before the info leak fix.

4. Get that version by running the command `git checkout 3621de89d8eac9d3b64302bfb2dc67e9a566decd`

5. Now that we have the older version of the repo, read `README.md` again to see if the credentials are there:
```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.MQXHpiW2ac/repo$ cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: 4pT1t5DENaYuqnqvadYs1oE4QLCdjmJ7

```

Password:\
`4pT1t5DENaYuqnqvadYs1oE4QLCdjmJ7`

## Level 30
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo` via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

### Solution
1. Make temp dir and clone the repo, where you need to specify ssh and connecting on port 2220:
```
bandit29@bandit:~$ cd $(mktemp -d); git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo
```
Type in the password for bandit29

2. Inspect the `README.md` file in `repo`:
```
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.lKZ2qoOxIp$ cd repo/
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.lKZ2qoOxIp/repo$ cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for bandit30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: <no passwords in production!>

```
The file states that the password is not in production meaning the password was not leaked in the commits. However, there may be more branches that could contain it.

3. List out all the branches:
```
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.lKZ2qoOxIp/repo$ git branch -v -a
* master                     6ac7796 fix username
  remotes/origin/HEAD        -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev         081ac38 add data needed for development
  remotes/origin/master      6ac7796 fix username
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev 7226732 add some silly exploit, just for shit and giggles
```
Perhaps `remotes/origin/dev` will contain sensitive information as it seems to be a development branch.

4. Checkout `remotes/origin/dev` by running command `git checkout remotes/origin/dev `

5. Read the `README.md` file:
```
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.lKZ2qoOxIp/repo$ cat README.md
