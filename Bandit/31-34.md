## Level 31
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo` via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

### Solution
1. Make temp dir and clone repo, inputting the password for bandit30

2. Go into the `repo` folder and read the `README.md` file:
```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.k5cdoJ3YAC$ cd repo/
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.k5cdoJ3YAC/repo$ cat README.md 
just an epmty file... muahaha
```

3. Use the packfiles to identify previous blobs:
```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.k5cdoJ3YAC/repo$ find .git/objects -type f
.git/objects/pack/pack-a6731702834ff96b2fa34b52c4170c9ca20e3fec.pack
.git/objects/pack/pack-a6731702834ff96b2fa34b52c4170c9ca20e3fec.rev
.git/objects/pack/pack-a6731702834ff96b2fa34b52c4170c9ca20e3fec.idx
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.k5cdoJ3YAC/repo$ git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-a6731702834ff96b2fa34b52c4170c9ca20e3fec.idx

```

4. Read the first blob:
```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.k5cdoJ3YAC/repo$ git cat-file -p 84368f3a7ee06ac993ed579e34b8bd144afad351

```

Password:\
`fb5S2xb7bRyFmAvQYQGEqsbhVyJqhnDy`

## Level 32
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo` via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

### Solution
1. Make temp dir and clone repo into it, inputting password for bandit31

2. Go into `repo` and read the `README.md` file
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```

3. Create `key.txt` and put the content `May I come in?` into it: 
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ touch key.txt
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ vi key.txt 
```

4. Add `key.txt` to stage, using `-f` to force it:
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ git add key.txt 
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
key.txt
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
hint: Turn this message off by running
hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ git add -f key.txt 
```

5. Commit the staged files for pushing
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ git commit -m "Push file"
[detached HEAD 522c62e] Push file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 key.txt
```

6. Push the file to get the password
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ git push
fatal: You are not currently on a branch.
To push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)
state now, use

    git push origin HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>

bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.uh0qfHomRr/repo$ git push origin HEAD:master

## Level 33
After all this git stuff, itâ€™s time for another escape. Good luck!

### Solution

```
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> $0
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
tQdtbs5D5i2vJwkO8mEyYEyTL8izoeJ0
$ 
```

Password:\

## Level 34
At this moment, level 34 does not exist yet.

### Solution
1. Read the `README.txt` file
```
bandit33@bandit:~$ cat README.txt
