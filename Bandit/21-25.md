## Level 21
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

### Solution
Since it says that it will read a line of text *from the connection*, it means that you need to listen to the port for the request sent to the SSH ID. Then when you send in the password from the 2nd terminal to log in, it should return the password to the next level if the passwords match on the 1st terminal running `suconnect`.

To set up the listening port on the 2nd terminal, use *netcat*:
```
ncat -lvp 9999
```
where the port number is arbitrary, as long as it is not used. You can check which ports are in use with *netstat*:
```
netstat -ln --inet --inet6
```

In the 1st terminal, connect to the listening port:
```
./suconnect 9999
```

Return to 2nd terminal and input the password for the level `0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO`.

The 1st terminal output:
```
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 2232
Read: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1
ERROR: This doesn't match the current password!
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 9999
Read: 0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
Password matches, sending next password
```

The 2nd terminal output:
```
bandit20@bandit:~$ ncat -lvp 9999
Ncat: Version 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on [::]:9999
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:9999
Ncat: Connection from 127.0.0.1:36184.
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt
```

The sent password should've been matched and returned the password to the next level.

Password:\
`EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt`

## Level 22
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

### Solution
Seeing the contents of */etc/cron.d* showed:
```
bandit21@bandit:~$ ls /etc/cron.d
cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24  e2scrub_all  otw-tmp-dir  sysstat
```

The likely target is `cronjob_bandit22` so inspect the contents:
```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

We can see that the the command, `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh`, runs every minute but has its output voided, so maybe there is potentially something noteworthy in the script file.
```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

The script shows that the password for bandit22 was directed to `/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`, so inspect that file's contents.
```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q
```

Password:\
`tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q`

## Level 23
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

### Solution
List out the */etc/cron.d* directory:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ ls /etc/cron.d
cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24  e2scrub_all  otw-tmp-dir  sysstat
```
`cronjob_bandit23` is the likely target.

Inspect the contents of that cronjob:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
```

Inspect the contents of `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh`:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh 
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

The script runs `whoami`, gets the MD5 hash of it and then copies bandit23's password into */tmp/[MD5 hash]*.

Since the command would be run as bandit23, you could manually get the MD5 hash and read the temp file:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga
```

Password:\n
`0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga`

## Level 24
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

## Solution
As above, we are probably looking for `cronjob_bandit24`:
```
bandit23@bandit:~$ ls /etc/cron.d
cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24  e2scrub_all  otw-tmp-dir  sysstat
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
```

Seeing the contents of `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh`:
```
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

The script goes to `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`. The if condition skips over `.` and `..` in the directory. The code inside kills the process if the script doesn't stop after 60 seconds. Then it recursively removes all the files.

We likely need to create a script file to read bandit24's password before deletion. This will be done by injecting `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` with our password extraction script.

Create a temp folder and script:
```
bandit23@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ vi bandit24_pass.sh
```

We can then createa a script that will read bandit24's password from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24` and copy it into our temp folder:
```
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU/password
```

Set the necessary permissions to the folder and the file:
```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ chmod +rx bandit24_pass.sh 
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ rm password.txt 
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ chmod 777 /tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ touch password
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ chmod +rwx password
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/tmp.mGPtDxFuKU$ ls -la
total 17016
drwxrwxrwx 2 bandit23 bandit23     4096 Feb 19 05:36 .
drwxrwx-wt 1 root     root     17412096 Feb 19 05:37 ..
-rwxrwxr-x 1 bandit23 bandit23       73 Feb 19 05:36 bandit24_pass.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 bandit23 bandit23        0 Feb 19 05:36 password
```

Copy the password extraction script into the target folder:
```
cp bandit24_pass.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo/bandit24_pass.sh
```

Now you need to wait at most one minute for the cronjob to execute, and then read the password file.

## Level 25
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

## Solution
The description likely calls for a brute force script to brute force 4-digit pincodes on port 30002.

See how the brute force login will work by testing it out:
```
bandit23@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30002
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga 0000
Wrong! Please enter the correct current password and pincode. Try again.
```

We can see that wrong responses will say "Wrong", so we can filter it out in results.

To host the script file, make a temp directory and create the script:
```
bandit24@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.HmhRMQGWoV
bandit24@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.HmhRMQGWoV
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.HmhRMQGWoV$ vi brute-force.sh
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.HmhRMQGWoV$ chmod +x brute-force.sh 
```

Create the brute force script
```
#!/bin/bash

PASSWORD=gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8
PORT=30002
SECRETS=secrets.txt
OUTPUT=results.txt

for i in {0000..9999}; do
    SECRET="$PASSWORD $i"
    echo "$SECRET" >> $SECRETS
done

cat $SECRETS | nc localhost $PORT > $OUTPUT
```

Run the script:
```
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.HmhRMQGWoV$ ./brute-force.sh 
```

Filter out "Wrong!" from `results.txt`:
```
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.HmhRMQGWoV$ cat results.txt | grep -v "Wrong!"
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4
```

Password:\n
`iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4`
