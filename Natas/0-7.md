## Level 0
1. Inspect the source code with Ctrl + U, and there will be a comment containing the password

## Level 1
1. Again, inspect the source code with Ctrl + U, and find the comment with the password

## Level 2
1. Inspecting the source code there is the tag:
```
<img src="files/pixel.png">
```
2. Go to `http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/`, where it can be accessed publicly and should show a table of files
3. Open `users.txt`
4. It should contain the contents, and password for natas3:
```
# username:password
alice:BYNdCesZqW
bob:jw2ueICLvT
charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
natas3:3gqisGdR0pjm6tpkDKdIWO2hSvchLeYH
eve:zo4mJWyNj2
mallory:9urtcpzBmH
```

## Level 3
1. The source code has a hint in the comment: "Not even Google will find it this time...", which may suggest a disallowed route. This could be found in `robots.txt`
2. Go to `http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt`, where the disallowed route is `/s3cr3t/`
3. Go to `http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/`, where there is a table of files
4. Open `users.txt` to find natas4 login

## Level 4
1. The hint box states when accessing `http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php`:
```
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
```
This suggests we need to modify the request to the site to pretend we are natas5
2. Intercept the request to access `http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org` with Burp, and change the Referrer field to `http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org`
3. The natas5 password should be given

## Level 5
1. Intercept the request to `http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org`, and modify the Cookie field to `loggedin=1`
2. The natas6 password should be given

## Level 6
1. View the source code, where you can see an included file:
```
include "includes/secret.inc";
```
2. Go to `http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc`, where you find the secret:
```
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
```
3. Input this secret in the home page to get the password natas7

## Level 7
1. When clicking on Home page, the URL shows `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home`, and ABout page shows `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=about`. There may be an LFI attack posisble
2. Trying out `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=.`, shows error message:
```
Warning: include(/var/www/natas/natas7): failed to open stream: Not a directory in /var/www/natas/natas7/index.php on line 21

Warning: include(): Failed opening '.' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php') in /var/www/natas/natas7/index.php on line 21
```
We are currently in the `/var/www/natas/natas7/` directory, meaning to try access `etc/natas_webpass/natas7`, we need to inject the payload:
```
../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas7
```
3. Go to `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas7`
4. The natas8 password should be shown
